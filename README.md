# Image Semantic Search Engine Using CLIP AI Project 🌐
🍎 In this project, we will build an image semantic search engine using CLIP AI. The search engine will allow users to search for images based on their image vectors generated by CLIP AI Encoder. We will be using Qdrant as our vector database to store and query image embeddings efficiently. The project consists of several key steps, which are outlined below.

## Steps
👉 0. Download and Run Qdrant Docker Image
First, we need to download and run the Qdrant Docker image. Qdrant is a vector database that will help us store and query our image embeddings.

Tutorial link below:
* https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/
```bash
$ docker pull qdrant/qdrant
$ docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z qdrant/qdrant
```
Replace `$(pwd)` with your desired directory
👉 1. Load the Wearing Dataset to Qdrant
Next, we will load our dataset into Qdrant. The dataset consists of images of various clothing items, which we will use for search.
so now Download Products.json to "/Data" and open a new Python Environment.
👉 1.1 install requirements.txt and CLIP AI
CLIP AI install link below:
* https://github.com/openai/CLIP
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install ftfy regex tqdm
$ pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```
👉 1.2 load Data to qdrant vector database
```bash
$ python src\0InitDatabase.py
```
👉 2. Run Flask Search Engine API
```bash
$ python src\searchEngingeFlask.py
```
👉 3. Git Clone and Run React UI Application
get it from link below:
* https://github.com/AMMIROSOH/ise-react
```bash
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
👉 4. Test the Search Engine
